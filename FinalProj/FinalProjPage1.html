	<h2>United Nations Goal 4 - Quality Education</h2>

	<h3>Afghanistan</h3>
	<p>Of the nearly 14,000,000 children aged 0-14 in Afghanistan, nearly 3,700,000 (or almost 40%) are not in school. Many children living in rural areas lack access to schools, due to mountainous terrain throughout the country. Of the children that make it to school, many do not receive a quality education, since only 48% of Afghan teachers have the minimum qualifications for teaching.</p>

	<h3>Pakistan</h3>
	<p>Of Pakistan's 51,200,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16, around 22,600,000, or around 44%, are not in school. In some areas of Pakistan, the percentage of children not attending schools reaches 70%. In fact, survival rate between 2015 and 2016 decreased from 69% to only 6%. Furthermore, over 20% of public schools only had one teacher, and 14% had only one classroom. 29% of public schools have no drinking water, and 40% have no electricity.</p>
	<p>Despite all of these setbacks, Pakistan's education system has been making improvement, and enrolment in schools in all sectors has increased by around 1,300,000 children between 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, availability of electricity has increased from 56% to 60% and drinking water from 66% to 71%.</p>

	<h3>Sub-Saharan Africa</h3>
	<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, 20% of children aged 6-11 are not in school, 33% of children aged 12-14 are not in school and 60% of children aged 15-17 are not in school. "56% of children, or 387 million, wonâ€™t achieve minimum proficiency levels by the time they should be completing primary education", says Bridge, an organization dedicated to securing a quality education for all children around the world. Overall, between 2000 to 2013, education rates decreased in 14 of the 45 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
