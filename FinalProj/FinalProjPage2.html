	<h2>United Nations Goal 5 - Gender Equality</h2>

	<h3>Saudi Arabia</h3>
	<p>Saudi Arabia made the news recently when it lifted its driving ban on women. Many people in Saudi Arabia and around the world celebrated this decision in favour of women's rights, however numerous problems still persist and it is important to not lose sight of them. First and foremost, this decision was almost certainly motivated by the desire to attract foreign investors to boost the Saudi oil industry.</p>

	<h3>Afghanistan</h3>
	<p>Women in Afghanistan face many barriers in getting jobs; a report from the International Development Law Organisation detailed how women in Afghanistan have it much harder when it comes to finding a job. Furthermore, according to Zainab Fayez, the only female prosecutor in the province of Kandahar, Afghanistan, says that many women are afraid to report incidents of domestic violence or abuse. In a recent case, a nurse who reported the sexual assault of two girls, aged 6 and 7, was nearly thrown in jail for a false accusation before the perpetrator was convicted.</p>

	<h3>Pakistan</h3>
	<p>According to the World Economic Forum, Pakistan ranks second-last out of 149 countries in terms of gender equality (though it should be noted that many were sceptical of the report placing Pakistan below Saudi Arabia and Yemen). Another report, this time from the United Nations, says that 12% of women aged 18-49 in Pakistan (nearly 5,000,000) are simultaneously deprived of education, healthcare, employment and are married as children. The report also says that nearly 80% of Pakistani women do not have access to clean supplies for cooking, 25% lack sanitation services and 7% live over half an hour away from a source of clean water. Furthermore, over 40% of women in Pakistan are child brides, including nearly a quarter of women in the upper class, and over 60% of the most disadvantaged.</p>
