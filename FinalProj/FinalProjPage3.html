	<h2>Link Between Two Goals</h2>

	<h3>Afghanistan</h3>
	<p>Of the nearly 3,700,000 children in Afghanistan who are not in school, 60%, or 2,200,000 are girls. Girls often lack equal access to schooling throughout Afghanistan. Furthermore, many girls (around 17%) marry before they turn 15, further preventing them from achieving an education. Some of the main issues include access to education (ie. natural barriers, such as mountains) and social norms that keep women from achieving an education.</p>

	<h3>Pakistan</h3>
	<p>Pakistan has around 22,600,000 children not in school. This includes nearly half of all girls in Pakistan, compared to 40% of boys. Looking at primary school, 32% of girls, but only 21% of boys, are not in attendance. By the age of 11, nearly 60% of girls are not in school, and nearly half of boys. The province of Balochistan had the worst rates of non-education, where 81% of women, and only 52% of men, had not finished primary school. In fact, three quarters of Baloch women had never even attended school. Throughout Pakistan, gender disparities in education persist, no matter how high the education rates are.</p>
	<p>Some of the factors limiting women's access to education include political upheaval and traditionalistic views on gender. Many girls face violence and even honor killings for attending school, such as Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by a Taliban gunman on October 9, 2012, as she rode home from school. As if that was not enough, many women (around 21%) are married while they are still children, further preventing them from getting an education.</p>

	<h3>Sub-Saharan Africa</h3>
	<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, of the 15,000,000 children aged 6-11 who are not in school, 60% of them are girls. 36% of girls compared to 32% of boys aged 12-14 are not in school. In Sub-Saharan, a large factor for many girls is marriage, even pregnancy, as many girls in Sub-Saharan Africa are married young. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 43% of girls are married before they turn 18.</p>
